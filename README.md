# EditorX


EditorX is an IDE for Web Development for android phones . i was always interested into making some kind of editor or IDE and this is the product of those desires . 
<ul>
<li><b>Support for HTML , CSS , JS </b><br></li>
tried to create an application which can enable user to code in HTML , CSS and JS easily with EditorX . just one step away to test your code . 
you can link the CSS or JS files with HTML by mentioning their path or you can directly integrate CSS or JS in HTML files . everything is seemless . 
<br>
<br>
<li><b>Code Highlighting</b><br></li>
all the codes are highlighted so you can easily differentiate betweeen codes and can focus on developing web page instead of managing codes . 
all tags and attributes are highlited with different colors so you can easily make the changes in existing code . 
<br>
<br>
<li><b>File Management</b><br></li>
all though being Web IDE , you can also create any type of file using EditorX but you can only open HTML , CSS and JS files in app . 
also you can have a dedicated panel to switch between multiple files and can manage them efficiently .
